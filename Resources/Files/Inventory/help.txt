# Welcome to the Inventory System!
This system allows you to manage items and inventories for your Discord server.

## Commands:

### Base:
- `inventory view [user] [item]` — View your or another user's inventory (in DMs).
- `inventory show [user] [item]` — Show your or another user's inventory in the current channel.
- `inventory give [user] <item> [amount]` — Give items to a user.
- `inventory remove [user] <item> [amount]` — Remove items from a user.
- `inventory change [user] <item> [amount]` — Change the quantity of an item for a user.
- `inventory clear [user] [item]` — Clear a user's inventory or a specific item.
- `inventory info <item>` — Get information about a specific item.
-# Parameters may be entered in any order. Ensure you enter only one of each type (user, item, amount).
-# If <user> is not provided, the command targets your own inventory. You may otherwise use a @ping or their ID.
-# The <amount> parameter may be decimal or whole, positive or negative. Use '=', '+', or '-' at the start to indicate how to change the amount (relative or absolute) or '%' to use a percentage of the previous quantity.

### Administration:
- `manage_inventory` — Initialize or configure the inventory system.
- `manage_inventory help` — Show this help message.
-# Only server administrators may use this command
-# Administration by command is not yet implemented and can only be done through json files by a bot developer.
